Day 1

Recently, I've been unable to stop playing the RPG game "Shattered Pixel Dungeon" ([SPD]). It's a rogue-like game where you play as a hero (with four different occupations) exploring the secrets of a dungeon. The game has a port for the [switch platform], but I want to create a new version specifically for the switch that includes more Joycon features.

I don't have any experience in game development, so this will be a challenge for me. But as the saying goes, a good beginning is half the battle, so I'll start by listing some goals for version 0.1:

    A single hero class: Warrior
    No audio
    One original boss

[SPD] is an open-source game and its code can be obtained from Github. It's based on the source code of [Pixel Dungeon] by [Watabou] and both games were written using the Java library [libgdx]. However, I want to practice my C programming skills, so I plan to rewrite the game using C and release it on the [switch platform].

After a long search, I couldn't find a good C-based library for the homebrew [switch platform] that is similar to [libgdx]. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I have chosen to use a 2D vector drawing library on top of OpenGL, named [nanovg], for the UI and visualizations.
